Edinburgh Hacklab
=================

About
-----

Edinburgh Hacklab is part of the worldwide movement of Hackerspaces.

What is a Hackerspace?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Shared spaces for people who mess around with technology for fun.
By creating a shared space to do this, we provide access to better
facilities than we could each have at home, as well as opportunities
to collaborate, learn, and socialise.

Our Location
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Edinburgh Hacklab is located at Summerhall, just at the East edge of
the Meadows.

* 1 Summerhall
* Edinburgh EH9 1PL

Visit us
^^^^^^^^

You're welcome to visit the Hacklab any time we're open. The lab isn't
staffed regularly during office hours but we do have a regular **open
night every Tuesday from 7pm** until late.

Become a member
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You don't need to be a member to come along to our open nights, but if
you want to be part of Hacklab and get 24 hour access, join us!
