About
=====

Edinburgh Hacklab is part of the worldwide movement of `Hackerspaces <http://hackerspaces.org/>`_
-- shared spaces for people who mess around with technology for fun. By creating a shared space
to do this, we provide access to better facilities than we could each have at home, as well as
opportunities to collaborate, learn, and socialise.

Edinburgh Hacklab was launched on 24th August 2010 and is now based at `Summerhall <http://www.summerhall.co.uk/>`_
on the south side of Edinburgh. If you'd like to see or use the space, :doc:`contact <contact>`
us or come to one of our open :doc:`events <events>`.
